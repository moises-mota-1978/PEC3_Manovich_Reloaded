# Legal Code Defined
Every Creative Commons license has three layers: the lawyer-readable legal code, the human-readable deed, and the machine-readable code. As the only legally-operative layer, the legal code is the primary layer of the CC licenses. It consists of the text of the licenses, as well as any meaningful formatting and other inseparable elements listed below. The English-language, HTML-format version of the legal code is the canonical version. 

## Elements of legal code
Anything not specifically named as legal code above, including:

- “CC is not a law firm” disclaimer at top
- Creative Commons notice at bottom
- “Using Creative Commons licenses” text and formatting
- Particular method of textual emphasis within the license
- Navigational links (including internal navigation links within the license text)
- Link color
- Text color
- Coloring or design of background, including headers and footers and links they may include, pop-ups (if any), and flags
- HTML and other coding that does not change the user’s view of legal code elements
